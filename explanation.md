# Test Results Explanation

```python
import unittest

from my_sum import sum
from fractions import Fraction


class TestSum(unittest.TestCase):
```

## Test 1: Summing a List of Integers

 ```python
    def test_list_int(self):
        """
        Test that it can sum a list of integers
        """
        data = [1, 2, 3]
        result = sum(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, 6)
```

The test results show that the first test, which checks summing a list of integers, passed successfully, as expected. The function correctly computed the sum of [1, 2, 3] to give 6 as expected.

## Test 2: Summing a list of Fractions

```python
    def test_list_fraction(self):
        """
        Test that it can sum a list of fractions
        """
        data = [Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(2, 5)]
        result = sum(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, 1)
```

 However, the second test, which checks summing a list of fractions, initially failed due to an incorrect assertion in the test itself. The expected value was incorrectly set to 1, but the correct sum of the fractions is 9/10.

## Test 3: Corrected Fraction Test Case

 ```python
     def test_list_fraction_correct(self):
        """
        Test that it can sum a list of fractions
        """
        data = [Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(2, 5)]
        result = sum(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, Fraction(9, 10))
```

 This issue was proven by the fact that my corrected function, test_list_fraction_correct, works fine with the updated expected value. Once the assertion was corrected, the test passed, confirming that the function properly handles the summation of fractional values.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## Conclusion

 In conclusion, the results indicate that the function works as intended for integers, and the issue with the fraction test was purely due to an incorrect expected value in the original test.
